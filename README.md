See [BeautifulSoup Quickstart Guide](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#quick-start)

Choose a BeautifulSoup parser:

- 'html.parser' (default, you get this with BeautifulSoup)
- 'html5lib' (install separately if desired)

## Getting Started

Fork (copy into your GitHub account) and clone down (to your machine) this repo to get started with web scraping.

## Copied web-scraping.ipynb and completed Project 6

Copied web-scraping.ipynb to this repository, and then completed Project 6. A rather extensive (for me) dive into NLP and Web Scraping, culminating in the creation of histograms to show my results.
